Subteam One: Will work on the client application development, focusing on creating a JavaFX user interface that interacts with the library API. our project proposal is a McDonalds-like menu for ordering food and paying for it
Subteam Two: Will focus on the library, which includes the development of the API that the client application will use.

Will schedule meetings between teams to discuss what we have done. Each group please add new files on the repository with the code they are working on and update with branches as they iterate to it.
